# Getting Back Into Coding ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently refreshing my **core programming knowledge** and sharpening up on the **basics** as I get back into coding. This repository (and others youâ€™ll see from me soon) are part of my journey to:

- Rebuild foundational skills  
- Revisit important concepts and syntax  
- Practice consistency and clean coding  
- Regain confidence through small, focused projects  

Whether it's simple scripts, algorithm challenges, or framework experiments, everything here reflects progress, learning, and momentum.

Stay tuned â€” more coming soon!
